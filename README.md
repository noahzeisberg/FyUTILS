# Disclaimer

# Installation

To install FyUTILS, ensure you're running the latest versions of Windows and Windows Terminal. Also, you should be using an account with administrator permissions.

1. **Setting up the execution policy:**
   Open your PowerShell and paste the following command to bypass the remote code execution policy. This step is necessary for the installation to proceed.
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
   ```

2. **Installing FyUTILS:**
   Execute the following command in the current PowerShell session to start the installation:
   ```powershell
   irm https://noahonfyre.github.io/FyUTILS/get.ps1 | iex
   ```

3. **Starting FyUTILS:**
   To run FyUTILS, execute the `fyutils` command in a new shell session.


### Troubleshooting Guide
If something doesn't work, or you can't get FyUTILS to start, try the following steps:

1. **Restart your shell sessions:**

   Ensure you restart all your shell sessions. This includes closing all instances of PowerShell and Command Prompt, as they need to register the update to the system variables.

2. **Restart your PC:**

   If restarting the shell sessions doesn't resolve the issue, try restarting your PC. This will force all processes to restart and retrieve the most recent system variables.

3. **Check your PATH variable:**

   Open your search bar and search for `PATH`. Click on the section `Environment Variables`. Check the `PATH` variable for the path `C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\.fyutils`. If the path doesn't exist, add it to the variable.

4. **Get technical support:**

   If you need further help with the installation or setup of FyUTILS, you can check out our [discord server](https://dsc.gg/nyronium).

5. **Standalone EXE:**
