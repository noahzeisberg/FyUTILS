## Reporting a Vulnerability
You can report a vulnerability [through this form](https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/FyUTILS/security/advisories/new).

Only the newest version will recieve security updates, because you can easily update your instance using the `update` command.

Please note that it can take several days/weeks for me to fix the vulnerability, because I sometimes just don't have time for coding.
